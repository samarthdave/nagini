True or False: Stratified sampling allows for controlling for possible confounders in the sampling stage, while blocking allows for controlling for such variables during random assignment.

1 / 1 point

[ ] True
[x] False

Correct
Stratifying and blocking both allow for controlling for potential confounders, but at different stages of the study design. We stratify when we sample (divide population into strata and sample from within each stratum), and block in the process of random assignment (divide sample into blocks and randomly assign from within each block to treatment groups).

As part of a statistics project, Andrea would like to collect data on household size in her city. To do so, she asks each person in her statistics class for the size of their household, and reports that her sample is a simple random sample. However, this is not a simple random sample. Which of the following is the best reasoning for why this is not a random sample that is appropriate for this research question?

1 / 1 point

- [ ] Andrea did not block for any variables that might influence the response.
- [ ] Andrea did not use a stratified sample.
- [x] Andrea did not use any randomization; she took a convenience sample.

Correct
This question refers to the following learning objective(s):

Distinguish between simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling, and recognize the benefits and drawbacks of choosing one sampling scheme over another.

Which of the following is not one of the four principles of experimental design?
1 / 1 point

[ ] replicate
[ ] randomize
[x] stratify

Correct
The question refers to the following learning objective: Identify the four principles of experimental design and recognize their purposes: control any possible confounders, randomize into treatment and control groups, replicate by using a sufficiently large sample or repeating the experiment, and block any variables that might influence the response.
